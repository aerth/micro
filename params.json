For Ubuntu:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install xclip\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't have xclip or xsel, micro will use an internal clipboard for copy and paste, but it won't work with external applications.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nOnce you have built the editor, simply start it by running `micro path/to/file.txt` or simply `micro` to open an empty buffer.\r\n\r\nMicro also supports creating buffers from `stdin`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ifconfig | micro\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can move the cursor around with the arrow keys and mouse.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the mouse to manipulate the text. Simply clicking and dragging will select text. You can also double click\r\nto enable word selection, and triple click to enable line selection.\r\n\r\nYou can run `$ micro -version` to get the version number. Since there is no release, this just gives you the\r\ncommit hash. The version is unknown if you built with `go get`, instead use `make install` or `make` to get a binary\r\nwith a version number defined.\r\n\r\n#### Help text\r\n\r\nSee the [help text](./runtime/help/help.md) for information about keybindings, editor commands, colorschemes and\r\nconfiguration options.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs, please report them! I am also happy to accept pull requests from anyone.\r\n",
